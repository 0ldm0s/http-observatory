## Frequently Asked Questions

** What is the scoring methodology based on? **

It is extremely difficult to assign an objective value to a subjective criteria such as "How bad is it that a given site doesn't implement HTTP Strict Transport Security?"  This is complicated by the fact that what may be bad for one site -- such as not implementing Content Security Policy (CSP) on a site that contains user information -- may not be as bad for another site.

The scores and grades offered by the HTTP Observatory are based on the opinions of a wide variety of information security professionals, and largely reflect the relative importance written about in the official [Mozilla web security guidelines](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Guidelines/Web_Security).
